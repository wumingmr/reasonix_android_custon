# Contributing to Reasonix

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Reasonix! This guide covers
everything you need to get started.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.26+** — use the toolchain pinned in `go.mod` (`GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`)
- **Git** — for version control
- **Node.js 24+ and pnpm 10** (optional) — only if you work on the desktop app
  (`desktop/`)

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/esengine/DeepSeek-Reasonix.git
cd DeepSeek-Reasonix
go build ./cmd/reasonix    # builds the CLI binary
go test ./...              # runs the full test suite
```

### Dependency direction

```
cli → {agent, plugin, config} → {tool, provider}
```

Built-in subpackages import their parent to self-register via `init()`.
Parents never import children.

## Development workflow

### Building

```bash
make build          # go build ./...
make test           # go test ./...
make vet            # go vet ./...
make fmt            # gofmt -w .
make hooks          # install git hooks (pre-push: go vet)
make cross          # cross-compile for all 6 targets
```

### Isolated development environment

A source-built binary shares no on-disk state with a stable release when launched
with `REASONIX_HOME` set. This gives each build its own self-contained directory
tree — config, credentials, sessions, cache, skills, commands, hooks, and
desktop tab state — so the two builds never interfere:

**CLI**

```bash
REASONIX_HOME=/tmp/reasonix-dev go run ./cmd/reasonix
# or after building:
#   REASONIX_HOME=/tmp/reasonix-dev ./bin/reasonix
```

**Desktop**

```bash
scripts/desktop-build.sh darwin/arm64 v0.0.0-dev   # one platform per run
```

On Windows, use `$env:REASONIX_HOME` in PowerShell or `set REASONIX_HOME=` in
Command Prompt; the binary extension is `.exe`.

The directory is empty on first launch; the app behaves exactly like a fresh
install. Every subsequent write — config saves, credential storage, session
logs — stays under `REASONIX_HOME`. Legacy migration, OS-home convention
directory scanning, and all other fallback paths are skipped so no production
data leaks in or out.

### Cache-first review gate

Reasonix treats high prompt-cache hit rate as product behavior. Changes that
touch provider-visible system prompt construction, memory prefix, output styles,
skill index behavior, default tool surfaces, tool schemas, provider request
serialization, compaction, or MCP/tool registration need explicit cache review.

For these changes:

- Keep system prompt changes low-frequency and require explicit review.
- Fill the PR body `Cache-impact:` line with `none`, `low`, `medium`, or `high`
  plus the reason.
- Fill the PR body `Cache-guard:` line with the focused guard test/command added
  or run, or explain why an existing guard covers the change.
- Fill `System-prompt-review:` when system prompt, memory prefix, output style,
  or skill index behavior changes.
- Prefer focused guard tests near the changed surface; `scripts/cache-guard.sh`
  remains the broader release-level cache-hit check.

CI enforces this metadata for cache-sensitive paths so prompt/tool prefix churn
is called out before review.

### Running tests

```bash
go test ./...                           # all tests
go test ./internal/agent/ -v            # verbose, one package
go test ./internal/tool/builtin/ -run TestGrep  # one test
```

Choose checks by the changed contract. Documentation-only changes need content
and link checks; Go changes need owning-package tests and applicable vet/lint
checks. Broaden to `go test ./...` for shared behavior. Desktop Go is a separate
module: run its affected packages or `cd desktop && go test ./...`.

For Go changes, format the changed files and use `make lint` (golangci-lint at
`.golangci-version` plus repolint). `go vet` does not cover all lint rules.
Install the pinned linter with `make lint-install` if needed. Repeat successful
checks only when new changes or unresolved risks justify it.

When adding an internal import, check the target package's test imports for a
reverse dependency and run the target package tests to catch setup cycles.

Desktop transcript scroll and history changes follow the
[scroll and history contract](docs/TRANSCRIPT_SCROLL_CONTRACT.md), including the
single writer, the bounded reading window, and deterministic regression cases via
`pnpm test:transcript` in `desktop/frontend/`.

Keep correctness gates deterministic. Prove concurrency and lifecycle ordering
with channels, injected clocks, state transitions, or emitted events instead of
asserting that an operation finishes within a small wall-clock interval on a
shared CI runner. Use a generous timeout only as a liveness watchdog. Performance
limits belong in an explicit benchmark that records evidence and uses the
benchmark's documented sampling rule; host integration probes may report an
advisory result when the runner cannot provide a controlled environment.

### Code style

- `gofmt` is enforced by CI — format before committing
- Follow existing patterns: wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Library code never calls `os.Exit` or prints to stdout/stderr
- Only `cli/` and `main/` decide exit codes and user-facing messages
- Exported identifiers need useful doc comments; explain non-obvious constraints
  rather than restating code. Mechanical limits live in
  `tools/repolint/comments.go` and `tools/repolint/main.go`.
- `TODO(#nnn):` and `HACK(#nnn):` need an issue anchor; `FIXME` is rejected.
- Keep one responsibility per file. Repolint ratchets existing debt: an edit
  cannot silently increase a file's recorded debt. Prefer removing redundancy
  or extracting a coherent owner.
- A narrow baseline adjustment may carry existing debt through a rename or
  extraction, or cover a small measured capacity increase whose design is clearer.
  Explain the before/after values and rationale. Longer comments are justified
  for non-obvious protocol, concurrency, compatibility, or recovery invariants.
  Do not add broad slack, disable checks, or weaken correctness/security tests.

### Commit messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(glob): add ** recursive pattern support
fix: replace silent error discards with structured logging
test(event): add comprehensive unit tests for event package
docs: add CONTRIBUTING.md
ci: add golangci-lint and govulncheck
```

### Review updates and PR metadata

Use ordinary follow-up commits and fast-forward pushes. Amend or force-push only
when explicitly authorized, after verifying the remote head. Keep unrelated
changes out of the PR.

Two CI guards read the PR body. The scripts are the source of truth and both
run locally: `scripts/check-cache-impact.sh`, `scripts/check-docs-impact.sh`.
Separators must be an ASCII `-` or `:` — an em dash fails the docs guard.

Cache-sensitive diffs (`internal/tool/`, `internal/provider/`,
`internal/boot/`, `internal/agent/agent.go`, and the rest of the list in the
script) require:

```
Cache-impact: <none|low|medium|high> - <reason>
Cache-guard: <focused guard test/command or existing guard rationale>
```

`none` is a legitimate impact when the provider-visible prefix stays
byte-identical; only an empty value, `todo`, or `tbd` is rejected. If the diff
also touches `internal/config/`, `internal/memory/`, `internal/outputstyle/`,
`internal/skill/`, or `internal/boot/`, add `System-prompt-review: <note>` —
that field additionally rejects `none` and `n/a`, so it must name the explicit
prompt reviewer or approval.

User-visible diffs (`cmd/reasonix/`, `desktop/`, `npm/`, and most of
`internal/`; tests and lockfiles are exempt) require one of these, chosen by
whether the same PR edited `docs/*.md`:

```
Documentation-impact: updated - <what changed>            # docs/*.md edited
Documentation-impact: none - <why the docs stay correct>  # not edited
```

## Adding a new built-in tool

1. Create `internal/tool/builtin/mytool.go`
2. Implement the `tool.Tool` interface: `Name()`, `Description()`, `Schema()`, `ReadOnly()`, `Execute()`
3. Register via `func init() { tool.RegisterBuiltin(myTool{}) }`
4. Add tests in `internal/tool/builtin/builtin_test.go` or a separate `mytool_test.go`
5. The tool is automatically available — `main` blank-imports `builtin`

## Adding a new model provider

(For MCP tool servers see `internal/plugin` instead — that's a different layer.)

1. Create `internal/provider/myprovider/`
2. Implement `provider.Provider`: `Name()`, `Stream()`
3. Register via `func init() { provider.Register("mykind", New) }`
4. The provider is available from config with `kind = "mykind"`

## Adding i18n strings

1. Add the field to `internal/i18n/i18n.go` (`Messages` struct)
2. Add the value in `internal/i18n/messages_en.go` and `messages_zh.go`
3. The `TestCatalogsComplete` test will fail if you miss a locale

## Submitting changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main-v2`
3. Make the change and add regression coverage for affected behavior
4. Run the relevant checks above and satisfy required CI checks
5. Ensure changed Go files are formatted
6. Submit a pull request to `main-v2`
