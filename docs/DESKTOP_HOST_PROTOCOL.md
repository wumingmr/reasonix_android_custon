# Desktop host protocol

[简体中文](DESKTOP_HOST_PROTOCOL.zh-CN.md)

The Electron shell and the Go desktop service are two processes joined by one
private, versioned JSON-RPC 2.0 connection over the service's stdio. This
document is the contract both sides implement. The Go side owns every desktop
business command; the Electron side owns every native surface. Neither side
may reach around the contract: the React UI never touches Electron or Go
globals, and Go business code never links a shell toolkit.

## Historical session archive receipts

`ArchiveSessionTarget` accepts a retained historical source without first
publishing an active session. Canonical selectors keep their existing identity;
source selectors explicitly address the retained source version. A validated
unchanged conversion follows its adopted target's lifecycle. A changed source
is saved in full under an independent identity and committed directly archived.
The original target's deletion tombstone is never reused or removed.

`SessionMutationResult.outcome` is optional: `archived`, `archived_copy`, or
`already_removed`. The last result means a proven residual source receipt was
registered for an already deleted target, not that content was restored. Missing
or unknown outcomes use the existing generic committed-result behavior. Clients
apply identity aliases and lifecycle fences only after `committed: true`.

Historical source archives use the existing `archive-import` child and `archive`
parent journal. Unpublished import reservations may transfer to this archive
flow under an observed-state check; orphan archive children never publish active
membership. Source errors `source_unavailable` and `source_ambiguous` retain the
source and return a sanitized explanation. Content, provider requests and the
session storage schema are unchanged by this RPC addition.

## Transport

- Framing: newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 (`rpcwire` strict mode). One frame
  per line, UTF-8, no batch arrays.
- The Go service is started as `reasonix-desktop --host-rpc`. Its stdout carries
  only protocol frames; stderr carries logs. The shell closes stdin only after
  `desktop/shutdown` has reported `completed`; closing stdin without that result
  is treated as `connection_lost` and runs bounded cleanup.
- Limits: 64 MiB per inbound frame on both sides, 512 concurrent inbound
  handlers on the service, 30 s write-stall watchdog. Large binary payloads never
  travel in frames; they use the resource origin below.
- Every request the shell makes runs on its own goroutine, exactly as the
  retired in-process shell
  bound calls did. Ordering is only guaranteed for `desktop/event` frames,
  which the service writes from one queue.

## Handshake

The first request on a fresh connection must be `desktop/hello`. Anything else
fails with `-32002 not_ready`.

```jsonc
// shell → service
{"method":"desktop/hello","params":{
  "protocolVersion": 11,
  "contractDigest": "sha256:…",       // digest embedded in the shell bundle
  "build": {"version":"v1.30.0","channel":"stable","commit":"abc123"},
  "host": {"name":"electron","version":"44.2.0","chrome":"152.0.0","platform":"darwin","arch":"arm64"},
  "instance": {"home":"/Users/…/.reasonix","dev":false}
}}
// service → shell
{"result":{
  "protocolVersion": 11,
  "contractDigest": "sha256:…",
  "service": {"version":"v1.30.0","channel":"stable","commit":"abc123","pid":4242},
  "runtimeGeneration": "g-01J…",       // new for every service process
  "instance": {"identityVersion":3,"identityDigest":"sha256:…","legacyId":"com.reasonix.desktop.…"},
  "runId": "…", "incidentId": "…", "diagnosticsEnabled": true,
  "resources": {"origin":"http://127.0.0.1:51234","token":"…"},
  "window": {"width":1280,"height":820,"minWidth":760,"minHeight":480,"frameless":false,"zoomFactor":1}
}}
```

`instance` is optional for cross-version compatibility. New services publish a
versioned digest from the shared filesystem identity resolver plus the legacy
instance ID. The shell consumes these opaque values for diagnostics and never
uses the digest as a filesystem path. Older shells ignore the object and newer
shells accept its omission.

`window` is the initial main-window geometry Go derives from the saved state
and platform rules. Optional `position: {x, y}` carries the saved origin (zero
and negative coordinates are valid); omission requests centering. The shell
selects the matching display and fits the rectangle to its DIP work area before
creating the hidden window. Go later maximises and shows it from `domReady`,
without overriding the shell's corrected position. Persistence always captures
the normal-state rectangle, separately from the maximised flag; legacy oversized
rectangles are fitted rather than resetting every maximised entry to defaults.
While minimized, the shell retains its last non-minimized snapshot because
native normal-bounds queries can otherwise expose the maximized frame.

The persisted JSON shape is unchanged. Older shells ignore the optional hello
position; newer shells accept its omission. Ship shell and service together:
mixed development builds do not provide the complete restore fix. Downgrading
can reintroduce the old geometry bug, and older readers may reject negative
origins below their previous validation floor.

Failure codes are terminal: the shell shows the real error and offers
"open logs" and "quit". It never falls back to the browser mock.

| Code | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-32001` | `protocol_mismatch` | `protocolVersion` differs |
| `-32003` | `contract_mismatch` | command/event digest differs (mixed install) |
| `-32004` | `build_mismatch` | shell and service versions differ and neither is `dev` |
| `-32005` | `instance_mismatch` | the shell's canonical data home differs from the service's |
| `-32002` | `not_ready` | request before a successful hello |

`runtimeGeneration` tags every event and every approval or browser grant
minted by this service process. A restarted service issues a new generation;
the shell discards anything tagged with an old one.

`runId` identifies this service run. `incidentId` links service and shell
lifecycle evidence for the same failure chain. Both are random diagnostic
identifiers; they do not contain a PID, local path, or user content. When
diagnostics are disabled (including a `dev` service build), `diagnosticsEnabled`
is false and both identifiers are empty strings; the keys are always present.

## Lifecycle requests (shell → service)

| Method | Params | Result | Go owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `desktop/start` | `{}` | `{}` | `App.startup` |
| `desktop/domReady` | `{}` | `{}` | `App.domReady` |
| `desktop/rendererAttached` | `{"rendererGeneration":n}` | `{}` | frontend heartbeat/readiness |
| `desktop/beforeClose` | `{"reason":"window"\|"quit"\|"tray"\|"updater"}` | `{"prevent":bool}` | `App.beforeClose` |
| `desktop/shutdown` | `{"requestId":string,"reason":string}` | shutdown phase/result | coordinated, retryable shutdown |
| `desktop/shutdownStatus` | `{"requestId":string}` | same shutdown phase/result | query after timeout/unknown result |
| `desktop/hostEvent` | `{"name":string,"payload":any}` | `{}` | second instance, tray open/quit, menu actions |
| `desktop/browserControl` | `{"enabled":bool}` | `{}` | built-in browser switch, read when a session is built |

Order: `hello` → `start` → window load → `domReady` → (`rendererAttached` after
each renderer mount) → … → `beforeClose` → (`shutdown` completed → stdin close
fallback → exit). A shutdown RPC timeout is an unknown result: the shell queries
`shutdownStatus` and keeps the window open on a retryable failure. An abrupt
stdin EOF enters the same coordinator with reason `connection_lost`; it does
not create a second cleanup flow after a completed shutdown.

The shell publishes a `stopping` service phase before the shutdown RPC. During
that phase readiness is false and new business calls are rejected, while the
shutdown and shutdown-status requests retain the existing service session.
Clean exit removes the current temporary file under
`diagnostics/lifecycle`; an empty lifecycle directory after exit is expected.
Rotating `logs/shell.log` is the durable post-exit record. See
[Windows close and transcript diagnostics validation](WINDOWS_CLOSE_TRANSCRIPT_VALIDATION.md).

## Business commands

```jsonc
{"method":"desktop/invoke","params":{"method":"OpenProjectTab","args":["/path", true]}}
{"result": {...}}                                  // the method's JSON result, null for void
{"error":{"code":-32000,"message":"<error text>","data":{"method":"OpenProjectTab"}}}
```

`method` must name an exported method of the Go `App` value that the contract
registry accepted. Signatures follow the rules the retired shell used: any
  JSON-serialisable
parameters and a result of `()`, `(T)`, `(error)` or `(T, error)`. The
registry rejects anything else at build time, so the surface can never gain a
method the shell cannot call. The shell validates `method` against the
embedded command list before forwarding. Unknown names fail with `-32601`.

The generated contract (`cd desktop && go run . -emit-contract frontend/src/generated`)
is the single source of truth: it emits the JSON contract, its digest, the
TypeScript command table and the DTO type declarations consumed by the
renderer. A desktop Go test fails when the checked-in output drifts.

Each command also records its source-module `domain`, exact `owner` (for
example `App.OpenProjectTab`), repository-relative `sources`, `scope` and
`cancellation`; these fields are included in the digest. The generator scans
all platform declarations and writes `desktop/host_command_owners.generated.json`,
which the host embeds and validates against every reflected command. Scope
records the owner's named wire `inputs` (`argN` for unnamed legacy parameters)
and `resolver`; zero-input commands use `owner-state`, others `owner-inputs`.
These are provenance and dispatch boundaries. Input validation, tab/session
selection and access checks remain in the existing App method.

Current App commands declare `before-dispatch`: the host checks cancellation
before decoding and immediately before dispatch, then preserves the method's
result even if cancellation arrives during a synchronous write. They do not
promise interruption after dispatch. A host method may opt into
`cooperative-context` with a leading Go `context.Context`; the host injects
the request context and excludes it from JSON arguments and generated DTOs.
The method must cooperate with cancellation. Business Stop/Cancel commands
continue to use their existing owners and semantics.

## Events (service → shell → renderer)

```jsonc
{"method":"desktop/event","params":{"seq":1093,"generation":"g-01J…","name":"agent:event","args":[{...}]}}
```

`args` preserves the variadic payload of the previous event bridge; most
events carry one element. The shell forwards the frame to the renderer on the
`reasonix:event` channel; the preload API `on(name, cb)` filters by `name` and
calls `cb(...args)`. Sequence numbers are strictly increasing per generation
so a renderer that re-attaches can detect a gap and re-snapshot instead of
trusting stale state.

Both the service supervisor and preload reject duplicate or out-of-order
frames; the preload also rejects old generations using the current service
state. It binds the transport before React subscribes. A generation change,
sequence gap or missed subscription raises the shell-local `desktop:resync`
event (`generation`, `reason`, `expectedSeq`, `actualSeq`), which is not a Go
business event. Runtime state is re-read through `SyncRuntimeState`; mounted
controllers re-read `ListTabs` and use the existing `TurnEventsForTab` ledger
and pending-prompt presentation to repair their projection. Reads are fenced
against newer recovery requests and session/navigation changes. No business
mutation is replayed, and a surviving application renderer is reattached
after a service restart without reloading its unsent drafts.

This recovery currently covers core runtime state, session metadata, durable
turn events and pending prompts. Terminal output has a bounded snapshot but
no atomic output cursor, so an affected terminal is visibly marked incomplete
instead of merging an ambiguous snapshot into live output. Extension output,
file-watch and other independent event streams still need capability-specific
resnapshot contracts; they are not covered by this core recovery guarantee.

## Native host calls (service → shell)

These replace direct shell-toolkit calls in Go. Each maps to one method of the
Go `nativeHost` interface; the Wails implementation was retired when the Electron shell
landed.

| Method | Params | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host/window.show` | `{"reason":string}` | `{}` |
| `host/window.hide` | `{}` | `{}` |
| `host/app.hide` | `{}` | `{}` (macOS application hide) |
| `host/window.maximise` `unmaximise` `minimise` `unminimise` `toggleMaximise` `center` | `{}` | `{}` |
| `host/window.isMaximised` `isMinimised` | `{}` | `{"value":bool}` |
| `host/window.setPosition` | `{"x":n,"y":n}` | `{}` |
| `host/window.setTitle` | `{"title":string}` | `{}` |
| `host/screen.list` | `{}` | `{"screens":[{"x","y","width","height","scale","primary"}]}` |
| `host/dialog.openDirectory` | `{"title","defaultDirectory"}` | `{"path":string}` (`""` = cancelled) |
| `host/dialog.openFile` | `{"title","defaultDirectory","filters":[{"displayName","pattern"}],"multiple":bool}` | `{"paths":[]}` |
| `host/dialog.saveFile` | `{"title","defaultDirectory","defaultFilename","filters"}` | `{"path":string}` |
| `host/dialog.message` | `{"type":"info"\|"warning"\|"error"\|"question","title","message","buttons":[],"defaultButton","cancelButton"}` | `{"button":string}` |
| `host/shell.openExternal` | `{"url":string}` | `{}` |
| `host/app.quit` | `{}` | `{}` |
| `host/app.relaunch` | `{"args":[],"execPath"?:string}` | `{}` |
| `host/devtools.toggle` | `{}` | `{}` |
| `host/remoteWindow.open` | `{"hostKey","url","title"}` | `{"windowId":string}` |
| `host/remoteWindow.navigate` | `{"hostKey","url","title"}` | `{}` |
| `host/remoteWindow.focus` `close` | `{"hostKey"}` | `{}` |
| `host/tray.ensure` | `{"openTitle","openTooltip","quitTitle","quitTooltip","tooltip"}` | `{"ready":bool,"reason":string}` |

`host/shell.openExternal` accepts only `http:`, `https:`, and `mailto:` URLs.
Other schemes, including `file:`, `javascript:`, and `data:`, are rejected at
the Electron host boundary before the system opener is invoked.
| `host/tray.destroy` | `{}` | `{}` |
| `host/browser.grant` `revoke` | `{"grantId","tabId","sessionId"}` / `{"grantId"}` | `{}` |
| `host/browser.tabs.list` | `{"grantId"}` | `{"tabs":[{"id","url","title","loading","temporary"}]}` |
| `host/browser.tabs.open` | `{"grantId","url","temporary"}` | tab |
| `host/browser.tabs.navigate` | `{"grantId","tabId","url","action"}` | tab |
| `host/browser.tabs.close` | `{"grantId","tabId"}` | `{}` |
| `host/browser.snapshot` | `{"grantId","tabId","selector"}` | `{"documentToken","url","title","tree","refs"}` |
| `host/browser.act` | `{"grantId","operationId","tabId","documentToken","action","ref","text","keys","options","files","submit","deltaX","deltaY"}` | `{"executed","reason","documentToken"}` |
| `host/browser.screenshot` | `{"grantId","tabId","ref","fullPage","directory"}` | `{"path","mime","width","height"}` |
| `host/browser.downloads` | `{"grantId","tabId","waitForMs"}` | `{"downloads":[{"id","url","path","state","bytes"}]}` |

Browser calls fail with `-32010` (stale reference), `-32011` (the user took the
tab over) or `-32012` (no current grant); the Go executor maps them onto the
kernel sentinels and records the operation outcome in its ledger. Grant
`tabId` is the desktop tab (the task); browser tabs opened under that grant
belong to it.

Host events (`desktop/hostEvent`): `tray.open`, `tray.quit`, `secondInstance`
(raw argv in `payload`), `menu.showWindow`, `remoteWindow.closed`
(`{"hostKey"}`), `browser.takeover` (`{"tabId","epoch","reason"}`).

Dialog results never expose file contents; they return paths that Go then
authorises through the existing workspace and media checks.

## Resource origin

The service listens on a loopback port for the existing authorised asset
handlers (`/__reasonix_workspace_media/…`, `/__reasonix_theme_asset/…`, the
remote markdown image proxy). The shell serves the packaged UI from the
privileged `reasonix://app/` scheme and forwards only those prefixes to the
resource origin, adding `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in the main process.
The token never reaches the renderer, a website view, a remote window or an
MCP App frame. Go keeps every file-identity and TTL check it has today.

## Renderer preload API

The trusted preload exposes exactly one object, `window.reasonixDesktop`:

```ts
interface ReasonixDesktopHost {
  readonly kind: "electron";
  readonly contract: { protocolVersion: number; digest: string; commands: readonly string[] };
  readonly platform: { os: "darwin" | "windows" | "linux"; arch: string; versions: Record<string, string> };
  invoke(method: string, args: unknown[]): Promise<unknown>;
  // Optional: preserve structured RPC errors across Electron contextBridge.
  invokeResult?(method: string, args: unknown[]): Promise<
    { ok: true; value: unknown } | { ok: false; message: string; code?: number; data?: unknown }
  >;
  on(name: string, cb: (...args: unknown[]) => void): () => void;
  native: {
    openExternal(url: string): Promise<void>;
    clipboard: { writeText(text: string): Promise<boolean>; readText(): Promise<string> };
    window: {
      setTheme(theme: "system" | "light" | "dark"): void;
      setBackgroundColour(r: number, g: number, b: number, a: number): void;
      getBounds(): Promise<{ x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number; maximised: boolean }>;
      isMaximised(): Promise<boolean>;
      minimise(): void; toggleMaximise(): void; close(): void;
    };
    getPathForFile(file: File): string;          // native drop paths
    onServiceState(cb: (state: ServiceState) => void): () => void;
    browserControl: {                            // settings page for the built-in browser
      get(): Promise<BrowserControlState | null>;
      setEnabled(enabled: boolean): Promise<BrowserControlState>;
      setIgnoreCertificateErrors(enabled: boolean): Promise<BrowserControlState>;
      clearCache(): Promise<void>;               // keeps cookies and site data
      clearAllData(): Promise<void>;             // cookies, site data and cache
      importChromeLogin(): Promise<ChromeImportOutcome>;
    };
  };
  browser: {                                       // user-driven browser panel; agent calls go through Go
    list(): Promise<BrowserTabView[]>;
    open(url: string, opts?: { temporary?: boolean; taskId?: string }): Promise<BrowserTabView>;
    close(tabId: string): Promise<void>;
    activate(tabId: string | null): Promise<void>;
    navigate(tabId: string, target: { url?: string; action?: "back" | "forward" | "reload" | "stop" }): Promise<void>;
    setZoom(tabId: string, factor: number): Promise<void>;
    toggleDevTools(tabId: string): Promise<void>;
    resume(tabId: string): Promise<void>;          // hand a taken-over tab back to the agent
    setLayout(rect: { x: number; y: number; width: number; height: number } | null): void;
    setOverlay(active: boolean): void;             // app overlays hide every website view
    onTabs(cb: (tabs: BrowserTabView[]) => void): () => void;
    onDownload(cb: (download: BrowserDownloadView) => void): () => void;
  };
}
```

`BrowserTabView` is `{ id, taskId, url, title, loading, canGoBack, canGoForward,
temporary, mode: "agent" | "human", epoch, zoom, error }` and
`BrowserDownloadView` is `{ id, tabId, url, filename, path, state, received,
total }`. Website views live in `persist:browser` (shared logins) or
`temp:<id>` partitions and never receive the application preload.

`ServiceState` is `{ phase: "starting" | "ready" | "restarting" | "failed" | "exited"; generation: string; error?: string }`.
Business components import the typed SDK, never this object; only the bridge
adapter reads it.

`BrowserControlState` is `{ controlEnabled, ignoreCertificateErrors, writable,
warning: "invalid-config" | "unreadable-config" | "unsupported-version" | null }`
and `ChromeImportOutcome` is either `{ ok: true, profile, cookies, skipped }` or
`{ ok: false, reason }` with `reason` one of `chrome-missing`,
`profile-not-found`, `cookies-unreadable`, `safe-storage-denied`,
`safe-storage-unavailable`, `unsupported-platform`.

## Performance diagnostics

The optional native calls below are restricted to the trusted app main frame.
Older shells may omit them. No persisted user-data format changes or migrations
are required.

- `processDiagnostics()` returns `{scope: "electron", samples, growth}`.
  Samples contain age, nullable CPU interval, process PID/type/creation time,
  nullable CPU percentage, working set and private memory in MiB, and a
  truncation flag. Sampling is limited to once per 30 seconds in the foreground
  and once per 60 seconds otherwise. Retention is at most 12 snapshots and five
  minutes, with at most 128 processes per snapshot. No titles, URLs or process
  names are collected. Electron-managed processes only; Go is excluded.
- `captureRendererProfile(requestId?)` records the current renderer through CDP for
  five seconds at a requested 10 ms sample interval. It returns a status,
  duration and at most eight app-script self-time summaries. Normal documents
  do not enable JS self-profiling. Capture is single-flight, requires the
  foreground window, observes a ten-minute cooldown, and allows at most three
  attempts per shell lifetime. Existing debugger/DevTools sessions are not
  taken over. Blur, hide, navigation, renderer loss or cancellation stops it.
- `cancelRendererProfile(requestId)` cancels only the matching capture; unscoped
  renderer cancellation is ignored. This also fences delayed requests across
  long suspension/resume gaps. Each CDP command has a
  1.5 second deadline and the owned debugger is released on every terminal path.
  Analysis runs in a disposable Worker with a 32 MiB old-generation limit,
  1.5 second deadline, and input limits of 20,000 nodes / 100,000 samples.
  Raw profiles never enter the UI report.
- `exportHeapSnapshot()` requires a user-confirmed native warning and save
  dialog. It saves locally without uploading, and accepts no renderer-supplied
  path. Snapshots may contain code, chats and secrets and can pause the renderer
  or use substantial disk space. Electron cannot preempt a snapshot: its busy
  lease remains held until the actual operation settles.

A memory growth signal requires a continuous PID plus creation-time identity,
at least five readings spanning two minutes, and three recent readings exceeding
the initial two-reading baseline by both 256 MiB and 50%. Private memory is used
when available throughout; otherwise working set is used. This is an observation
of sustained growth, not proof of a leak or exclusive physical RAM ownership.

Reports appear immediately. Process enrichment waits at most 750 ms; a bounded
CPU capture can update the same report later. The UI abandons capture enrichment
after 12 seconds and requests cancellation. These are asynchronous deadlines,
not preemptive limits on synchronous work. Dismissed reports never reappear.
The report distinguishes post-trigger samples from the already-ended long task.
User-requested heap capture suppresses pressure alerts during capture and for
the normal five-second settling grace afterward.

From `desktop/electron`, run `node scripts/performance-smoke.mjs` to verify the
production owner, Worker, report enrichment and local heap snapshot with an
isolated native fixture. `node scripts/performance-benchmark.mjs` compares off,
lightweight monitoring and short capture in three fresh-process trials each.
All modes use the same renderer bundle and runtime mode selection. Activity
signals are pinned and background throttling disabled for unattended native
measurement. Host event tests separately cover the production focus and
navigation cancellation policy; the smoke verifies actual CDP and ASAR paths.
It records CPU time where available, frame timings, working sets and metric
collection cost in `artifacts/performance/overhead.json`. This synthetic
benchmark is not a reproduction of the Windows user workload. Field comparison
must still cover startup, extended use, foreground return and closing tabs.

## Security boundaries

- The application window: sandbox on, context isolation on, Node integration
  off, `reasonix://app` only, preload above.
- Website views, remote Serve windows and MCP App frames: separate sessions,
  no preload from the application, no `reasonix://` access, no `host/*` reach.
- IPC handlers accept requests only from the application window's
  `webContents`. Any other sender is rejected and logged.
- `desktop/invoke` names outside the embedded contract fail before reaching Go.
