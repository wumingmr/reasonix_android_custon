# Reasonix Desktop shell (Electron)

The Electron process that hosts the React UI and supervises the Go desktop
service. The wire contract between the two is
[`docs/DESKTOP_HOST_PROTOCOL.md`](../../docs/DESKTOP_HOST_PROTOCOL.md); this
package implements the shell side of it and nothing else. Business logic stays
in Go, the UI stays in `../frontend`.

## Layout

| Path | Concern |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main/index.ts` | bootstrap: data home, single instance, privileged scheme, wiring |
| `src/main/service.ts` | Go service supervisor: spawn, stderr log, restart budget, shutdown |
| `src/main/rpc.ts` | NDJSON JSON-RPC 2.0 client (64 MiB frames, timeouts, reverse requests) |
| `src/main/handshake.ts` | `desktop/hello` params, result validation, failure descriptions |
| `src/main/window.ts` | main `BrowserWindow`, `host/window.*`, close and crash handling |
| `src/main/protocol.ts` | `reasonix://app` file serving and resource-origin forwarding |
| `src/main/ipc.ts` | renderer IPC: sender check, contract allowlist, native calls |
| `src/main/hostCalls.ts` | `host/*` dispatch table |
| `src/main/lifecycle.ts` | quit sequencing (`beforeClose` → `shutdown` → stdin close → exit) |
| `src/main/menu.ts`, `tray.ts`, `dialogs.ts`, `remoteWindows.ts` | native surfaces |
| `src/main/browser/` | in-app browser: website views, snapshots, actions, downloads, grants |
| `src/preload/index.ts` | the single `window.reasonixDesktop` object |
| `src/shared/ipc.ts` | channel names and types shared by main and preload |

## Browser surface

## Hardware acceleration recovery

The desktop UI exposes **Settings → General → System → Hardware acceleration**.
The preference is stored in the Electron shell profile and only takes effect
after a full application restart. If rendering fails before Settings can open,
fully quit Reasonix and start it once with `REASONIX_DISABLE_GPU=1`; this is a
temporary override and does not change the saved preference. The override is
supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The shell records GPU child-process failures separately from renderer failures
and memory growth. Two GPU failures within 60 seconds offer a native recovery
dialog; a renderer gets at most one reload in that interval. Renderer OOM and
startup-page failures go directly to recovery. A continuously unresponsive
window is offered recovery after 15 seconds, without claiming a GPU cause.
Normal exits and externally killed processes do not trigger GPU recovery.
After a healthy minute, recovery prompts are rearmed for later independent
failures. Acknowledging a dialog cannot clear a newer GPU failure that arrived
while it was open; transient stalls are rechecked before a delayed prompt.

**Restart in compatibility mode** disables hardware acceleration for that launch
only. After the renderer reports a healthy startup, a native dialog lets the user
keep acceleration disabled in the existing setting. Ordinary subsequent launches
otherwise use the saved preference. Restart interrupts active work, drains the Go
service, and attempts to save the draft. If draft saving fails or exceeds five
seconds during recovery, proceeding requires explicit confirmation of possible
unsaved draft loss. Ordinary exit retains its existing save requirements.

Recent explicit GPU failures are stored locally in `graphics-fault.json` in the
shell profile. The next launch of the same build can offer recovery if the user
has not acknowledged the failure and it is less than 24 hours old. A healthy
minute clears pending recovery. An unclean exit alone never counts as GPU
evidence. The versioned record preserves unknown fields; unsupported or corrupt
records are left untouched. `shell.log` includes graphics state, device details,
process exit reasons and process metrics; these additions do not upload data.

中文：默认仍开启硬件加速。GPU 进程在 60 秒内连续异常两次时，提供原生恢复
对话框；页面进程在同一时间窗口内最多自动刷新一次。页面内存不足、启动页崩溃
直接进入恢复；持续 15 秒无响应只报告界面故障，不直接归因于 GPU。
“以兼容模式重启”仅对本次启动关闭加速；成功启动后可选择保持关闭。
重启会中断任务，并先保存草稿、关闭后台服务。恢复时保存失败或超过 5 秒，
必须由用户确认可能丢失未保存草稿后才能继续。已保存的会话不会被清理。
本地 `graphics-fault.json` 仅保存明确的 GPU 故障；同版本、24 小时内未确认
的故障可在下次启动时提示，正常运行一分钟后解除待恢复状态。
恢复稳定一分钟后，后续独立故障仍可再次提示；关闭旧弹窗不会清除弹窗期间
发生的新 GPU 故障，已经恢复响应的短暂卡顿也不会触发排队的过期提示。

Validation: `pnpm --dir desktop/electron test:graphics-recovery` exercises real
Electron renderer termination and software rendering with scripted native-dialog
responses; GPU child-process events are injected, not a real driver crash.

The shell can host real websites next to the app UI (contract:
[`docs/DESKTOP_BROWSER.md`](../../docs/DESKTOP_BROWSER.md)). Every tab is a
sandboxed `WebContentsView` managed by `browser/surfaceManager.ts`; the React
panel drives it through `reasonixDesktop.browser.*` (user surface, no grant),
and Go drives it through the `host/browser.*` host calls
(`browser/hostCalls.ts`), which require a per-task grant that dies with the
service generation.

| Module | Concern |
| --- | --- |
| `guestView.ts`, `electronGuestViews.ts` | the `WebContentsView` behind injected interfaces; tests use fakes |
| `surfaceManager.ts` | tabs, layout/overlay visibility, take-over and crash recovery |
| `grants.ts`, `errors.ts` | per-task grants and the `-32010/-32011/-32012` contract codes |
| `snapshotScript.ts`, `snapshot.ts`, `pageScripts.ts` | serialised page walkers: aria-style snapshot, ref resolve/locate/select |
| `documents.ts`, `refResolver.ts` | document tokens; a navigation or take-over stales every earlier ref |
| `actions.ts`, `keys.ts`, `upload.ts` | trusted input dispatch: click, type, press, scroll, select, upload |
| `screenshot.ts` | element/full-page captures into the task scratch directory |
| `downloads.ts` | `will-download` routing, progress events, per-tab waits |
| `guestPreload.ts` | website-view preload; only reports user input for take-over |
| `fakeGuestViews.ts` | in-memory views so all of the above runs under plain `node --test` |

User input in a website view flips the tab to human mode (take-over), bumps
its epoch and is reported to Go as `browser.takeover`; `browser.resume` hands
it back. Agent-dispatched input is marked so its echo is not a take-over.
Downloads land in the task's scratch directory when one is registered by a
`browser.act`/`browser.screenshot` call, otherwise in
`userData/downloads/<taskId>`; the renderer hears about them through
`reasonixDesktop.browser.onDownload`.

## Build

Prerequisites: Node 24+, pnpm 10, Go. Install from the workspace root once:

```sh
cd desktop
pnpm install
```

`pnpm install` also downloads the Electron binary (`allowBuilds: electron` in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`). If `node_modules/electron/dist` is missing afterwards,
run `node node_modules/electron/install.js` inside `desktop/electron`.

Build the Go service and the UI, then the shell:

```sh
cd desktop
go build -o build/bin/reasonix-desktop-service .     # accepts --host-rpc
go run . -emit-contract frontend/src/generated       # desktopContract.generated.{ts,json}
pnpm --filter reasonix-desktop-frontend build        # frontend/dist
pnpm --filter reasonix-desktop-shell build           # electron/dist/{main,preload}.cjs + desktopContract.json
```

The shell build reads `frontend/src/generated/desktopContract.generated.json`,
recomputes its digest the way `hostrpc.Contract.Canonical` defines it
(sorted keys, compact, no HTML escaping), checks it against the
`DESKTOP_CONTRACT_DIGEST` the generator emitted, and writes the contract plus
`digest` to `dist/desktopContract.json`. A missing contract fails the build;
set `REASONIX_ELECTRON_ALLOW_MISSING_CONTRACT=1` to build without it (every
`desktop/invoke` is then rejected and the hello digest is empty).

Packaged shells read the full version tag, channel and commit from
`resources/build.json` for `desktop/hello`. `app.getVersion()` and
`package.json.version` are numeric native metadata and must not identify the
RPC build. The packaged startup smoke runs without development overrides and
requires the renderer's `Version` command to match that manifest; the service
used by CI must also be linked with the same non-development version.

## Run

```sh
cd desktop/electron
pnpm start                     # electron . against ../build/bin/reasonix-desktop-service
REASONIX_DESKTOP_SERVICE=/path/to/binary pnpm start
```

Development against the Vite dev server instead of the packaged UI:

```sh
cd desktop/frontend && pnpm dev                      # http://127.0.0.1:5173
cd desktop/electron && pnpm dev                      # REASONIX_DEV=1, loads REASONIX_ELECTRON_DEV_URL
```

Environment:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `REASONIX_DESKTOP_SERVICE` | path of the Go service binary (packaged default: `resources/service/reasonix-desktop[.exe]`) |
| `REASONIX_HOME` | data home, resolved exactly like `internal/config.ReasonixHomeDir` and sent in `hello.instance.home` |
| `REASONIX_DEV` | skips the single-instance lock and marks the instance as `dev` |
| `REASONIX_ELECTRON_DEV_URL` | loads this URL instead of `reasonix://app/index.html` |
| `REASONIX_FRONTEND_DIST` | overrides the directory served under `reasonix://app/` |
| `REASONIX_CHANNEL`, `REASONIX_COMMIT` | build identity in `hello.build` (default `dev`) |

Logs live under `<home>/desktop-shell/logs/`: `shell.log` (main process) and
`service.log` (the Go service's stderr), each rotating at 5 MB. In dev both
are echoed to the terminal.

## Verify

```sh
pnpm typecheck     # main + preload tsconfigs
pnpm test          # node --test; pure modules only, Electron is injected through interfaces
```

## Security boundaries

- The application window runs with `sandbox: true`, `contextIsolation: true`,
  `nodeIntegration: false`, no spellcheck, and loads only `reasonix://app`.
  Every navigation away from the app origin is blocked; popups are denied;
  `<webview>` is refused.
- The preload exposes exactly one object, `window.reasonixDesktop`, shaped as
  the protocol document's `ReasonixDesktopHost`. IPC replies are envelopes, so
  a Go error reaches the renderer as `Error(<Go message>)` with no Electron
  prefix.
- `ipcMain` handlers accept calls only from the main window's top frame
  (`event.sender` and `event.senderFrame` are both checked); any other sender
  is rejected and logged.
- `desktop/invoke` names are validated against the embedded contract before
  they reach Go; unknown names fail with a `-32601` error.
- `reasonix://app` serves files strictly under the frontend dist (no `..`,
  no absolute escapes, no directory index fallback except `/`). Only the
  three resource prefixes are forwarded to the loopback origin, and the bearer
  token is attached in the main process; it never reaches any renderer.
- Remote Serve windows use their own `persist:remote-<hostKey>` session, no
  preload, sandbox on, popups denied, navigation pinned to the page origin.
- Website views are sandboxed `WebContentsView`s on the `persist:browser`
  partition (`temp:<id>` for temporary tabs) with a preload that only reports
  user input. `host/browser.*` calls need a grant scoped to one task and one
  service generation; reads and writes refuse a tab in human mode.
- `shell.openExternal` from the renderer accepts `http:`, `https:` and
  `mailto:` only.
- The service is restarted automatically at most three times per five
  minutes after an unexpected exit; afterwards the failure page offers a
  manual restart, the logs folder, and quit. There is no mock fallback.

Packaging (`electron-builder`) is intentionally not part of this package yet.
