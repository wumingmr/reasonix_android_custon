package provider

// Two copies of a transcript are derived from the stored one: the bytes a
// provider receives, and the projection compaction writes back. They differ in
// exactly one field, and that difference is load-bearing.

// ModelMessages removes durable display-only records before a request is
// handed to any provider. Healthy sessions without such records keep their
// original backing slice, preserving the allocation and prompt-cache fast path.
func ModelMessages(msgs []Message) []Message { return projectMessages(msgs, false) }

// ProjectionMessages is ModelMessages for a stored projection, except that
// ToolExecution survives: a projection is also the next compaction's input, and
// only that record says a tool call failed. Stripping it here would leave the
// pass after next unable to classify the failure, so the strip belongs at the
// provider boundary, which every request path already crosses.
