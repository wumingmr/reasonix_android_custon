# Model settings runtime validation

This record distinguishes implemented behavior from release qualification. The change is not qualified for publication until the final candidate passes the complete matrix, including native Windows upgrade acceptance.

| Requirement | Owning implementation | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Save with no active session; default affects new sessions only | `desktop/model_settings_api.go`, `desktop/model_settings_preferences.go` | `TestModelSettingsSaveWithoutActiveSession`, default-model/new-session tests |
| Validate and compare before persistence; unknown fields retained | `internal/config/model_settings_edit.go`, unified API operation allowlist | `TestModelSettingsRequestRejectsStaleEdit`, `TestSaveModelSettingsPreservesUnknownFields`, catalog overlap tests |
| Copy-on-write credentials, grouped connections, failure recovery | `internal/config/model_credential_commit.go` | `TestModelSettingsGroupedCredentialCommitAndReceipt`, `TestModelSettingsFailedCommitCleansOnlyItsStagedCredential`, `TestModelSettingsCredentialWriteFailureKeepsConfig` |
| Current tool continuation retains its connection; next run refreshes | `internal/config/model_runtime_snapshot.go`, `internal/boot/boot.go`, `desktop/turn_admission.go` | `TestModelSettingsRunningToolContinuationKeepsOldConnection`, frozen-credential tests |
| FIFO follow-ups and bot requests use the new-run boundary | `internal/control/inbox_dispatch.go`, `internal/bot/model_settings.go` | `TestModelSettingsQueuedFollowupAppliesLatestBeforeDispatch`, `TestBotNewRunAppliesModelSettingsAndKeepsSessionOnFailure` |
| Per-project and inactive/detached application | Runtime-owner lookup and existing Desktop rebuild boundary | `TestModelSettingsProjectOverrideSkipsRebuild`, `TestModelSettingsRemovalRetryKeepsFailedTargetAndAppliesInactiveSibling`, `TestModelSettingsRetryAppliesDetachedRuntimeWithoutCreatingTab` |
| Startup and consecutive-save publication fencing | Startup model revision check and versioned deferred rebuild entries | `TestModelSettingsStartupPublicationRejectsCandidateBuiltBeforeSave`, deferred rebuild tests |
| Final lease invalidation preserves the old runtime and permits a safe retry | Final authority bind, fail-closed admission and refreshed authority before migration snapshot | `TestModelSettingsFinalAuthorityFailurePreservesRuntimeAndRecovers` releases the real lease immediately before final bind |
| Deletion blocks an unavailable next run without destroying history | Validated runtime model resolution | `TestModelSettingsLastProviderRemovalBlocksNewRun`, provider removal tests |
| Remote immutable routes, candidate ownership and automatic next-run application | `desktop/cred_proxy.go`, `desktop/remote_model_settings.go`, `internal/serve/model_settings_source.go` | `TestRemoteModelOwnershipRetiresOldRouteAfterInFlightRequest`, `TestRemoteModelSourceRefreshesAutonomousHTTPRunAndRetiresOldRoute`, Serve application-failure/receipt tests |
| Remote project configuration remains authoritative | `internal/config/model_runtime_settings.go` | `TestManagedModelSnapshotPreservesProjectProviderAndAssignments` |
| No architecture metadata in model prefixes | Transport-only snapshot metadata and unchanged serializers | `TestRemoteModelSnapshotPreservesWirePrefixAndKeepsKeysLocal` compares OpenAI, Anthropic and Responses request bytes |
| Saved/pending/failed states and draft races | Structured bridge result, request receipts, read/apply generations | `model-settings-receipt.test.ts`, `provider-editor-save-races.test.tsx`, settings refresh snapshot tests |
| Children created after a save and approval continuations retain the accepted snapshot | Boot-created child factories and controller approval resume | `TestModelSettingsChildCreatedAfterSaveInheritsAcceptedRunSnapshot`, `TestModelSettingsApprovalResumeKeepsAcceptedCredential` exercise actual HTTP requests |
| Source refresh supersession and uncertain completion | Shared runtime-owner refresh, source revision fencing and retained offers | `TestModelSettingsSourceFencesOvertakenBuildAndUncertainFinish` |
| Detached remote work retains its own admission boundary | `internal/serve/model_settings_detached.go` | `TestDetachedModelSettingsRefreshTargetsItsOwnerAndPreservesFailure`, `TestDetachedModelSettingsKeepsQueuedOwnerUntilAdmission` |
| Bounded remote ownership does not evict accepted routes | Proxy-scoped offer admission | `TestRemoteModelOfferCapacityPreservesOwnedRoutes` |
| Late ownership receipts and replaced connections cannot revoke current routes | Serve-wide incarnation/sequence, atomically pinned connection identity and route reconciliation | `TestRemoteOwnershipRejectsOvertakenReceipts`, `TestRemoteReplacedConnectionCannotPinOwnership`, `TestRemoteIncarnationReclaimsOldReservationsAndRejectsLateBuilders` |
| Rejected installs release reservations; unknown installs retain them until confirmed | Typed rejection and positive ownership readback | `TestRemoteInstallDistinguishesRejectionFromLostAcknowledgement`, `TestRemoteUnknownInstallRetainsOfferUntilOwned` |
| Controller shutdown prevents late inbox sidecar creation | Inbox open seal and synchronously registered publication kick | `TestClosedControllerCannotOpenInboxFromLateDispatch`, `TestStaleRecoveryCannotOverwritePublishedForegroundRoute` |
| Retired snapshots cannot overwrite the selected connection | Listing publication holds the current lease generation through metadata commit | `TestListingProjectionCannotOverwriteModelAfterAuthorityReplacement`, `TestListingAuthorityGuardRetainsGenerationThroughCommit`, `TestOwnedListingRejectsMissingAuthority`, `TestModelSettingsCredentialRefreshPersistsSelectedConnection` |
| Restored sessions show the correct connection before opening the selector | Catalog refresh follows readiness and session identity with stale-response fencing | `model-switcher-refresh.test.tsx`, native cold restoration with two connections sharing a model |
| HTTP retry retains accepted credentials after a save | Immutable provider credentials across transport retries | `TestModelSettingsHTTPRetryKeepsAcceptedCredential` returns an actual 503, then checks the retry and next runtime |

## Deterministic qualification

Run focused tests first, then race coverage for shared ownership, both Go modules, frontend types/tests/build and repository gates. Root tests do not include the nested Desktop module.

```sh
go test -p 4 ./...
go test -race ./internal/config ./internal/boot ./internal/control ./internal/bot ./internal/serve
(cd desktop && node ../scripts/desktop-windows-go-tests.mjs --all)
(cd desktop && go test -race . -run 'TestModelSettings|TestRemoteModel|TestCredentialProxy|TestDeferred')
(cd desktop/frontend && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test:all && pnpm build)
go run ./tools/repolint
```

The frontend test set includes receipt recovery, delayed editor saves, remote behavior and long-history performance. Uncertain writes are read back, never automatically repeated. Candidate route reservations protect builds, and Serve-wide ordered ownership receipts prevent stale status from retiring a published route. Offer release and retirement are atomic. Accepted old requests release their own references on completion.

## Background-process replacement and submission recovery

The background-scope change adds these regression owners. Local implementation
checks are separate from the historical release qualification below.

| Invariant | Regression owner |
| --- | --- |
| Gateway identity, output, cancellation and history survive repeated replacement | Desktop `TestModelSettingsGatewaySurvivesReplacementAndFailure`, with a real subprocess and local HTTP model |
| Runtime tasks block until actual exit; cancellation targets only selected blockers | jobs scope tests and control `TestModelApplicationCancelOnlySelectedRuntimeTasks` |
| Discarded candidates preserve processes and outgoing extension generation | boot `TestRebuildBackgroundCandidateFailurePreservesOwner`, `TestModelCandidateDiscardPreservesLiveExtensionManager` |
| Candidate initialization and retired callbacks cannot affect the new owner | control `TestModelReplacementFencesCandidateAndRetiredCallbacks` |
| Single-submit continuation validates all routes, credentials and limits | config continuation tests and Desktop model-application tests |
| Overtaken remote candidates never publish; uncertain finish is recoverable | Serve `TestModelSettingsSourceFencesOvertakenBuildAndUncertainFinish` |
| Reconnect/status refresh cannot revive old confirmations | Desktop `TestRemoteModelConfirmationExpiresOnReconnectAndNewRuntime` |
| Rejection preserves drafts/attachments; applying never resends | frontend submission tests and `node bench/model-application.mjs` |
| Structured rejection crosses the real Electron context bridge | `desktop/electron/scripts/smoke.mjs`, using the Go service and production renderer |

Full Desktop verification uses the inventory-verified runner:
`cd desktop && node ../scripts/desktop-windows-go-tests.mjs --all`.
Also run targeted Go race tests, root `go test ./...`, repository lint,
generated host-contract/inventory consistency, frontend types/build, browser
and native Electron probes. Concurrency regressions use channels and publication
boundaries instead of timing-dependent sleeps.

This change has macOS execution coverage and Windows cross-compilation checks.
Native Windows PowerShell process-tree cancellation/file-handle release and
native Linux process lifetime remain release-validation gaps. Historical
Windows results below **do not qualify this new lifecycle change**. No release
artifact is published by local checks.

Local qualification on 2026-09-23 passed root `go test -p 2 ./...`, all eleven
Desktop inventory-verified partitions, targeted ownership/submission race
tests, both Go linters (v2.12.2), repository lint, generated contract/inventory
checks, frontend production build/types/recovery tests, the browser recovery
probe and native Electron RPC smoke. Windows jobs and built-in shell test
binaries cross-compiled successfully. Root/package aggregate alarms were
diagnosed separately from test failures: reducing root parallelism preserved
the default alarm; the two largest Desktop partitions used a local 30-minute
aggregate budget without changing individual assertions or wait boundaries.

## Native Windows release gate

Native qualification completed on product commit `e0572c8c916c5d012770dcb2aeb98eab5361924a` using Windows 11 ARM64, Go 1.26.6, Wails 2.13.0, CGO and production frontend assets. The candidate executable SHA-256 was `C6E955C1491EC700E2A8A8806005998854A9071EFA7D552AF82F37BCA1F8B666`; the official 1.38.2 predecessor executable was `C20863C47A52B2D69F72E201D5FBAA3C57BC6132FF0AF69046FE0667D8E60B1D`. The isolated versioned installation retained its launcher, configuration home and history. Requests used a local HTTP fixture with disposable credentials; this does not claim real-provider compatibility testing.

| Native scenario | Required outcome | Qualification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Isolated 1.38.2 installation → in-place candidate upgrade | Same home and session files; no credential re-entry or configuration deletion | Passed through the existing launcher; saved connection and prior local/remote responses restored |
| Model preferences and model services with no active session | Save and read back; no implicit tab or model request | Passed with an injected pre-controller startup failure; default and credential saved, zero session files before/after, request count unchanged |
| Idle and running sessions | Existing default unchanged; accepted work uses old connection; next run uses new connection | Passed with a held HTTP request; next request used the saved credential. Existing flash session remained unchanged and a new local session used vision-exp |
| Restart and older-version read | Saved settings/history readable by candidate and 1.38.2 | Passed; both read the selected second connection and 17 local responses; 1.38.2 also read 14 remote responses. Candidate default changes preserved the existing flash selection while a new local session selected vision-exp |
| Desktop-managed remote proxy | Same-model key versions coexist; current request and next request use their respective keys | Passed through a real SSH connection and the candidate Serve; held and subsequent requests used their respective credential versions |

Final native requests 28–31 covered held/next SSH and local pairs with distinct credential generations. The no-runtime fixture saved its default and credential with zero session files and the request count unchanged at 31. The final full native Desktop suite passed in 212.733 seconds, following 50 focused repetitions. Native qualification found and repaired premature MCP process-context cancellation, credential pinning from display-only configuration reads, and clock-dependent prompt-history identity; the corresponding shutdown, metadata and frozen-clock regressions pass. Earlier failing runs were retained as diagnostic evidence.

Both Go modules passed their full suites; ownership race tests, frontend full tests and production build, both Go linters and repository lint passed. CodeQL passed after validating session filename components at their construction boundary. The later test-only commit `65cce8c90346f613f3a29584f694d9662b3f5a16` selects canonical noncolliding workspace-lock fixtures; four parallelism tests passed 1,000 race repetitions and the full workspacelease race suite passed. These test fixtures do not change the qualified product binary. Publication still requires terminal CI and review of the final PR head, followed by the release candidate gates. Documentation-only follow-ups do not change the qualified product binaries; any later product change requires reassessment. See [model settings](MODEL_SETTINGS.md) for persistence, downgrade and old-Serve behavior.

## Follow-up shutdown reassessment

Candidate push CI found that an autonomous inbox scan could still refresh its sidecar after controller shutdown returned. Product commit `580caee5be5346b86188a4f0027050e6d6d68c6e` joins sidecar opening and scans at shutdown, releasing the gate before host admission can retire its own controller. Controlled tests failed against the previous implementation for both `Close` and `ReleaseResources`; the fix passed 20 race repetitions and 1,000 repetitions of stale foreground recovery. Full root and Desktop suites, full control/serve/sessioninbox race suites, and lint passed.

The new Windows 11 ARM64 production executable had SHA-256 `0671CF45DA435560E66D5E694DD10C1BB0465E868DD5673E3003C734C9DC148D`. Native shutdown, self-retirement and stale-recovery tests passed 20 repetitions. The same isolated installation restored its 14-round SSH and 17-round local histories. New Desktop and Serve completed SSH request 32; a saved disposable credential applied through runtime replacement before SSH request 33, and local request 34 also used that credential. Both responses completed, the existing local flash selection remained unchanged, and native window shutdown ended the candidate process. Frontend assets and persisted formats were unchanged, so the earlier full upgrade, held-request and no-runtime matrix remains applicable alongside this focused reassessment.

Test-only commit `37b20ce5706e9c3b5b87c8ebbec0c78d273712fa` closes the bot fixture's process-wide history and usage catalogs before removing its temporary home. The old fixture reproduced SQLite sharing failures on Windows; the corrected bot suite passed 20 native Windows repetitions and 10 race repetitions. This commit does not change the qualified binary. These records establish product qualification; release completion still requires the final candidate CI, immutable tags and independent publication postflight.
